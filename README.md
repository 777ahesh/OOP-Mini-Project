### 1.1	ABSTRACT

Student Management System is a small application developed using C++. In older days the Teachers used to maintain their records in books and registers. Here we propose a new system, using this application we can store the Details. In manual method if we forget information book or register then it is very difficult to get the details. In manual mode it also becomes very difficult to update a particular record, also this system of storing data is inefficient. Some of the disadvantages of this manual system are:

-	Takes Up a Lot of Space. The biggest downfall to manual document filing is the amount of place it takes.
-	Prone to Damage and Being Misplaced. Manual document filing means you are placing faith in the people handling the files. 
-	Hard to Make Changes. 
-	Access Time.
-	Lack of Security. 
 
By using our application, we can see our data whenever we want, here we will have options like search record by name or using their id, insert new record and so on. This system is developed keeping in mind the general needs of the Teachers while maintaining the records.

### 1.2	INTRODUCTION

We have to implement a Student Management System using C++ programming language. To accomplish this task, we will have to use some kind of database which will store all the records and will maintain the records as well. As our Students Management system has limited fields using a File to store this data will be a good choice. SQL database can also be used for this task but as the scale of the project is small, we do not need a proper database to store our information.

## 2.1 Concepts which will be used in the Project.

Student Management System is a command Driven application that helps to maintain Student and faculty records. It makes use of unique IDs and password to restrict the access and usage of different areas of the portal to its correct audience.

The SMS(Student Management System) aapplication code makes use of wide array of c++ Programming features. These includes :
- Concept of inheritance for code reusability.
- Concept of function Overloading.
- Handling of Simple Exceptions.
- Application of file handling concepts for performing operations,such as read, write, append, check for various  I/O errors,etc.
- Use of various I/O manipulators to display the output in a formatted manner.
